# Python Code Quality Rules

## String and F-String Syntax
- **NEVER** use backslashes before closing brackets in f-strings (e.g., `data["text\])` is WRONG)
- When accessing dictionary keys in f-strings, use proper quote escaping:
  - Use single quotes for f-string delimiters and double quotes for dictionary keys: `f'{data["text"]}'`
  - OR use double quotes for f-string delimiters and single quotes for dictionary keys: `f"{data['text']}"`
  - NEVER mix escaping incorrectly: `data[" text\])` is invalid syntax
- Always ensure closing brackets `]` and parentheses `)` are properly closed without backslashes
- When writing one-liner commands, ensure all quotes and brackets are properly matched

## Dictionary Access in F-Strings
- Prefer: `f'Text length: {len(data["text"])}'` or `f"Text length: {len(data['text'])}"`
- Avoid: `f'Text length: {len(data[" text\])}'` (incorrect escaping)

## Code Generation Best Practices
- Always validate Python syntax before suggesting code
- When generating one-liner commands, break them into multiple lines if they become complex
- Use proper quote nesting: outer quotes should differ from inner quotes
- Test dictionary key access syntax in f-strings carefully

## Error Prevention
- Before suggesting code with nested quotes, verify the quote pairing
- Check that all brackets `[]`, parentheses `()`, and braces `{}` are properly closed
- Ensure no unnecessary backslashes are used before closing brackets
- When accessing dictionary keys in f-strings, use the opposite quote type for the key
